[3] reading was my first love. [4] i remember my grandparents’ house in india. i’d be a little kid on the floor going through all of my grandfather’s read- er’s digests, which is all he had to read. now, of course, there’s a smorgasbord of information out there—anybody can read anything all the time. back then, it was much more limited. i would read comic books, storybooks, whatever i could get my hands on. i think i always loved to read because i’m actually an antiso- cial introvert. i was lost in the world of words and ideas from an early age. i think some of it comes from the happy cir- cumstance that when i was young, nobody forced me to read certain things. i think there’s a tendency among parents\\n and teachers to say, “oh, you should read this, but don’t read that.” i read a lot which (by today’s standards) would be considered mental junk food.
